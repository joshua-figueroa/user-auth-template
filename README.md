# Login and Signup Template with E-mail Verification

User must signup to access the contents of the website. Upon signing up, a table with the user's name will be created under the users_data database. This table will serve as the storage for the files/data that the user wants to submit later on. An e-mail with a link will be sent to the user for verification purposes. Upon logging in, the user will be presented with a nice dashboard page.
